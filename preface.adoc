*Preface*

OGC defines interfaces that enable interoperability of geospatial applications.
API’s are a popular method to implement interfaces for accessing spatial data.
This White Paper provides a discussion of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
to support discussion of possible actions in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

* Chapter 1 – What is an API?
* Chapter 2 – API Design using Open Standards
* Chapter 3 – OGC API Essentials
* Chapter 4 – Open Standards and APIs.
* Chapter 5 – Summary of ideas for OGC activities for Open APIs

Annexes are provided on these topics:

* A. Examples of Web Mapping APIs
* B. Web APIs for Environmental Data - CSIRO Report
* C. The Open API Initiative and Specification
* D. APIs and implementation independence
* E. Open APIs and Licensing


This paper aims to help answer questions like:

* If you want to publish geospatial data on the web right now, what are the easiest ways to do so, considering fit-for-purpose?
* If you are developing your API how can you include essential geospatial elements reused from previous best practice?
* How to overcome “walls” of complexity and build on success of “pointy” APIs that are small and simple
