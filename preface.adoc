*Preface*

OGC defines interfaces that enable interoperability of geospatial applications.
API’s are a popular method to implement interfaces for accessing spatial data.
This White Paper provides a discussion of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
to support discussion of possible actions in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

* Chapter 1 – What is an API?
* Chapter 2 - Need for Interoperability across APIs
* Chapter 3 – API Design using Open Standards
* Chapter 4 – OGC API Essentials
* Chapter 5 – Open Standards and APIs

Annexes are provided on these topics:

* A. Examples of Web Mapping APIs
* B. Web APIs for Environmental Data - CSIRO Report
* C. The Open API Initiative and Specification
* D. APIs and implementation independence
* E. Open APIs and Licensing


The main themes of paper are:

* **APIs are popular** because they are an effective method for rapid software development in particular for distributed systems.  Examples of successful geospatial mapping APIs are listed in Annex A:   Google Maps, OpenLayers, MapQuest API for OpenStreetMap, Leaflet, Esri ArcGIS REST and Mapbox

* The proliferation of **API variations degrade interoperability** defined by web protocols.  The examples in Annex A show such variations in several parameters including "Zoom" level.   A summary of the differences of Zoom is provided in Chapter 2, Table 1 - Comparison of Map-related attributes from several APIs.

* **Protocols provide interoperability** when implemented consistently across APIs.   The OGC WMTS protocol when implemented across multiple APIs enables interoperability as demonstrated in the Figure at the end of Chapter 2.   By using consistently using the WMTS TileMatrixSet, graphics returned from several APIs can provide a consistent, composite map.  Similarly **consistent use of OGC Essentials** will improve interoperability (See Chapter 4).

* API implementation experience should be used to **improve the OGC Web Service Protocols**.  Several RESTful approaches for defining OWS protocols based on resource types are being considered in OGC.  Further, this white paper recommends that OGC consider activities that provide for consistent implementation of OWS protocols across multiple APIs (See in particular Chapters 3 and 4).
